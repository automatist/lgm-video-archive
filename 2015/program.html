 presentation will review Sri Lankan graphic design as a Case Study for 
the role of Libre Graphics tools and practices in the developing world. I
 work with a group of friends as a design studio / collective 
(mooniak.com) and we started using libre tools, mainly Inkscape / 
FontForge  for our design work around a year back. I will use some of 
the projects we do at mooniak.com to demonstrate my points. Over the 
last year we managed to work with clients to do their design projects 
and then publish the content under CC licenses. Each distinctive culture
 needs stock images, icons and fonts relevant to that culture. A 
proprietary model has not provided those design assets to the small 
market in Sri Lanka. Convincing clients to make projects libre is not 
easy. We have a simple model, clients get a discount if they wish to go 
libre. We can give a better price, because we don&#8217;t have the overheads 
(We work from home) software costs, and because we use open content.The 
other aspect I will focus is challenges that we faced in migrating as a 
group, coming from different backgrounds. And wrap up with few thoughts 
on why developing world is a better playground for Libre Graphics Tools.<br>

                  <p class="schedule_summary" style="display: none;">Hi!
 I am an SVG artist who produces CC vector illustrations to illustrate 
Wikipedia articles. Other wikimedians who have gone to LGM in the past 
have suggested that I give a talk at LGM about my work, since this is a 
rather new thing for Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects, as these 
projects have typically been stronger in text and photography. My 
illustrations have received dozens of awards from Wikimedia Commons, and
 I would like to give a talk about producing and contributing them. My 
Commons SVG portfolio can be found at 
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Kelvinsong/Portfolio.
<br>
I believe that this would be a valuable talk, because SVG is typically 
associated with HTML drawing and low-level technical diagrams, and there
 are few examples of the format being used for anything more 
sophisticated than graphs, schematics, and simple drawings, or more 
meaningful than proof-of-concept artistic renditions of cars or anime 
figures. I would like to tell people how SVG can be used to provide high
 quality textbook-level illustrations, and get more SVG artists involved
 in illustrating Wikipedia.<br>
                    <br>I am an American vector artist and 
type designer, who works exclusively in Inkscape, Blender, Fontforge etc
 and other free/open source apps. I have been contributing SVG 
illustrations to the wikimedia project for about two years, and at the 
time of writing, 31 of my images have made Commons Featured Picture 
status. One of the images I was also paid to write a tutorial for on 
VectorTuts 
(http://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/use-blender-and-inkscape-to-create-a-titans-atmosphere-infographic--vector-22221).
 I also do a lot of type design, and I used to do a lot of 3D art and 
animation in Blender.<br>

<br>
                    <br>
NGOs, journalists, government agencies, and cultural institutions all 
need photographs to tell their story and educate others. But there&#8217;s no 
way for those organizations to be in the right place at the right time, 
every time. That&#8217;s where we come in.
<br>
                    <br>
Through The List, organizations will provide lists of locations, people,
 and events that they need photographs of. And when users are in the 
right place at the right time, they can claim an item from the list and 
publish a photograph of it. 
<br>
                    <br>
All photos on The List (CC-BY) are freely licensed, meaning that everyone can use them.<br>

                  <p class="schedule_summary" style="display: none;">imgflo is a image processing server with a HTTP API,
<br>
using GEGL and node.js. Images are processed on-demand
<br>
by accessing an URL which specifies the input image,
<br>
operations to perform and associated parameters.
<br>
                    <br>
imgflo uses the Flowhub visual programming IDE to allow
<br>
image processing pipelines to be developed using
<br>
a visual, interactive, node-based editor.
<br>
The pipelines can then be deployed to the server,
<br>
or one can use them in other GEGL-based applications
<br>
- including GIMP.
<br>
                    <br>
The talk will cover motivation for an image processing server,
<br>
possible uses, and demo current capabilities.
<br>
                    <br>
The imgflo project was started after discussions at LGM2014,
<br>
and is used in production since October at thegrid.io<br>
                    <br>Jon is a software engineer at The Grid, responsible for the
<br>
image processing capabilities of their AI web publishing tool.
<br>
Since 2010 he has worked on several libre graphics projects,
<br>
including MyPaint, OpenRaster and GEGL.
<br>
In his spare time, Jon currently researches digital fabrication technologies
<br>
at the Bitraf hackerspace in Oslo.<br>

 our community. Most of the time she asked me to do teaching materials 
for her daily lessons in Filipino Language, Elementary English, Music, 
Arts and Physical Education subjects. Helping her is just like helping 
the young students to achieved better education, aside from that we also
 created and published a free-coloring book for the under privilege 
pupil in the 16 Daycare centers in our town Pagsanjan. Then after, with 
the permission of her superior, we convinced him to train students to 
compete for the TECHNOLYMPICS were students will participate and compete
 for manipulating images using free image manipulation software from 
different public elementary school in our Province (District, Cluster 
and Division levels), for the first time that Unson Elementary School 
participated in the competition they rank 2nd among the 324 competing 
public elementary schools. With joy in our endeavor and permission from 
his superior we continue to teach all the 31 public educators in the 
elementary school to help them with their daily teaching duties and 
spread the knowledge of using libre graphics software.<br>

 years later, the Libre Graphics ecosystem has become a galaxy made of a
 large number of projects that nourish it. This Galaxy develops because 
we help each other to grow. Going beyond with Libre Graphics involves 
sharing our practices with people who are not designers, programmers, 
artists or developers - with those who have not yet taken off.
<br>
                    <br>
In February 2015, Gr&#225;fica Liebre is launching an open women&#8217;s group 
called The Plums which will meet on a weekly basis. A space for 
thinking, learning and producing with Libre Tools and open practices in a
 feminist atmosphere. The aim is to share our knowledge regarding visual
 language with women who are interested, in order to broaden their 
capacity to read and produce, while promoting the Libre Graphics outlook
 amongst the 
<br>
female population. Working as a group and learning through practice, 
participants will become lucid and active visual readers and producers.
<br>
                    <br>
Given the time frame, this talk doesn&#8217;t present achievements, but rather
 aims to share the project in its initial stages and seeks to obtain 
valuable feedback from the Toronto meeting that can contribute to the 
successful development of this experience.<br>
                    <br>Myriam Cea (Madrid, 
Spain, 1975). I've always been interested in Arts and creativity; it's 
for that that I studied Sculpture (Escuela de Artes y Oficios La Palma, 
Madrid. 1997-2000), Engraving (Escola superior de disseny i art Llotja. 
Barcelona. 1995-2000), and finally Graphic Design (Escuela Superior de 
Dise&#241;o, Madrid. 2009-2013).
<br>
Among other professional activities related to design and its promotion,
 I'd been in charge of the Libre Graphics WorkStation in Medialab-Prado 
Madrid the last two years. At the same time I concived the idea of 
forming a working group on open source tools and practices. Today this 
group has become in an Association for Open Design and a graphic design 
studio, the first one that works exclusively whit libre tools in Madrid.
 We called it Gr&#225;fica Liebre, curretly leaded by Beatriz F. Est&#233;vez and

                  <p class="schedule_summary" style="display: none;">Are
 your graphics accessible to all audiences? This presentation introduces
 key concepts and methods behind accessibility.  It focuses on SVG on 
the web, but many ideas have broader applications, to the graphics you 
create and the tools you create them with.  
<br>
                    <br>
The talk will address the following questions:
<br>
- What does it mean for content to be accessible? Using the Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards, we ask: is it perceivable, 
operable, understandable, and robust?
<br>
- How can graphics be accessible?  It depends on their purpose: What 
information should they communicate?  How should they be interactive?
<br>
- How does SVG support accessibility? It features structured content, readable text, interactive links, and alternative text.
<br>
- How can accessible graphics be improved?  Web accessibility tools now 
support advanced interaction and document navigation using ARIA 
(Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes, but ARIA 1 did not 
emphasize graphics.
<br>
- What is being done now?  The W3C's SVG Accessibility Task Force is 
helping integrate ARIA and SVG, and providing guidance on best 
practices.
<br>
- How will this impact non-SVG graphics?  Annotated markup can be used 
in hidden fallback content for HTML Canvas graphics, and could be 
integrated in other XML-based vector graphics and charts.<br>

 reimagines CSS layout &amp; replaces the browser&#8217;s layout engine with 
one that harnesses the Cassowary Constraint Solver &#8212; the same algorithm 
Apple uses to compute native layout.
<br>
                    <br>
This presentation will demonstrate what can be done using GSS and how 
thinking layouts in terms of constraints is a very natural way of 
creating layouts. With constraints you can focus on the what rather than
 the how.<br>

                  <p class="schedule_summary" style="display: none;">The
 technologies needed to create realtime collaborative web applications 
have recently become much more accessible to web developers. Realtime 
web applications allow users to modify values without having to submit 
forms and/or reload the page, and any changes made by one user are 
propagated to other users&#8212;without them needing to reload the page 
either. While the software industry&#8217;s uptake of such techniques has been
 largely driven by the popularity of social network type applications, 
the mechanims work very well to create collaborative creative 
applications.
<br>
                    <br>
Two popular frameworks, Meteor.js and Derby.js, provide solutions for 
the synchronisation and data binding required to make such applications 
function. Eric will introduce these two frameworks and their respective 
strength and show how they are used within OSP. Eric details the 
creation of Ethertoff.js (with Derby.js) and demos the creation of a 
collaborative font drawing tool (with Meteor.js).<br>
                    <br>OSP makes 
graphic design using only free and open source software. A caravan of 
practitioners from diverse fields, they design, program, research and 
teach. Working for print and web and its hybrids, OSP creates visual 
identities and digital utilities, always digging for a more intimate 
relation with the tool.

 year at LGM we want to present where the Natron open-source software is
 headed and what it can do. The presentation will consist mainly of a 
demonstration of the new advanced features of Natron. We will show how 
to use Blender render layers in Natron to produce powerful and efficient
 effects. We will also emphasise groups in Natron and how they can be 
created to improve your workflow.

                  <p class="schedule_summary" style="display: none;">In
 the last year, Brussels-based design collective Open Source Publishing 
has used HTML to create printed publications. Some of them were only 
published in print, while others were hybrid publications appearing both
 in print and on-line or as slideshows. Some of these publications were 
built from scratch and others used the experimental CMS Ethertoff. In 
all cases a number of tools were needed to facilitate the transition 
from the screen to the printed page.
<br>
                    <br>
    In this talk OSP will showcase a number of projects: the visual 
identity for the Brussels Balsamine theatre, the hybrid publication &#8216;Are
 you being Served&#8217; that serves to document both online and in print the 
epynomous conference, and the art and theory periodical f-u-t-u-r-e.org.
 The presentation highlights the challenges which are posed when 
adapting screen technologies to the printed medium. OSP also profits 
from the occasion to introduce a series of tools called HTML2print which
 facilitate this process!<br>
                    <br>St&#233;phanie Vilayphiou is a young artist 
and designer investigating how software (transparently developed) can

                  <p class="schedule_summary" style="display: none;">Globalization
 has led to the need for multi-script and multi-lingual typography with 
demands for wide script coverage, comprehensive type-families that allow
 typographic differentiation in scripts that have not developed a 
tradition for this. The type and typography of some cultures and scripts
 have been more invested in than others, causing a gap in typographic 
standards. One such interesting gap are the features of a typeface 
family or system of typefaces that allow typographic differentiation. 
Complicating the issue further is the fact that some scripts have not 
developed a tradition to support this kind of differentiation. In 
display contexts there is also a demand for highly expressive vernacular
 type with a range of qualities and feelings found in the vast number of
 type styles available for the Latin script. These are  the serious 
challenges for a script like Tamil. At a micro design level the 
contrasting angular and circular forms with a lot of counter spaces are a
 challenge to harmonize. At the macro level, there is regional user 
preference for slanted type in body text or text for extended reading in
 India, and a diaspora community which may prefer an upright or 
un-slanted style. This talk will delve into these issues and speculate 
what steps are required for the moment.<br>
                    <br>Pria is interested in the
 problem solving aspect of design. Being a native of Chennai, India, the
 typographic standards of Tamil led her to pursue an MA in Typeface 
Design at the University of Reading. She consults for URW++, Monotype 
&amp; Google. Libre fonts are a natural extension of her interests in 
Indic Type-Design, as it is an effective platform that aids the 
transition of scripts into the digital future.</p>

 workshop would be based on my experience as professional illustrator. 
Illustrating a text is very different from making a poster or a logo, 
and there are specific techniques which are independent from whatever 
digital tool we are using (generating ideas from keywords etc). I'll 
talk briefly about those techniques and then I will focus on my workflow
 with Krita (which is the main tool I'm using currently) explaining :

                  </h3>
                  <p class="schedule_summary" style="display: none;">The
 Hybrid Publishing Consortium (HPC) is an Open Source publishing 
infrastructure research group and proposes an off site workshop and 
lightning talk for &#8216;Publishing from Archives&#8217; based on the Marshall 
McLuhan Archive, held at Toronto University. The archive contains video,
 audio, manuscripts and  experimental transmedia work of Marshall 
McLuhan himself. 
<br>
We use an Open Source tool chain of; Pando.ra (video archives), Tamboti -
 Heidelberg Research Architecture (collection management. Cluster Asia 
Europe, Heidelberg University) and famo.us (3D, GUI interface), Amara 
(video sub-titling. Participatory Culture Foundation) and Transpect 
(multi-format publishing. le-tex, Leipzig). 
<br>
With this tool set we allow users to author a data enrichment layer 
on-top of the existing collection data, allowing the public to become 
archivists and share their knowledge and insights. We use the model of 
the Book Sprints, but instead use transmedia content (video, audio, 
text, annotation etc) to create a trace on the archive or a new 
publication.
<br>
This &#8216;Media Sprint&#8217; user layer on the archive creating a rich visual and
 auditory interface, secondly it leaves a new data source on the archive
 which is VRA, MODS meta description US Library of Congress compliant.
<br>
The objective is to allow users to move from a light experience of 
creating &#8216;playlists&#8217;, to authoring on the involved level of Wikipedia. 
At the same time ensuring the data structure created is machine readable
 and so re-usable for&#8212;visual styling, citation, annotation, distribution
 and metrics etc.<br>
                    <br>Christina Kral:  As part of a transdisciplinary
 research team, Kral explores the future of publishing in relation to 
open educational technologies. In particular, Kral researches forms of 
communication and engagement, learning habits and routines and develops 
transitional platforms and encounters that push publishing beyond normal
 conventions. In her capacity as an artist, she explores practical 
utopias in form of experimental facilitation and publishing projects. 
She is co-creator of an educational reality game (YKON Game). She is 
co-founder of Betta Zine, an artistic research publication project that 
draws from first hand experiences with the goal to open multiple 
perspectives/entry points to seemingly contradictory combinations such 
as shopping &amp; war, education &amp; war. She has been awarded artist 
residencies &amp; stipends at Eyebeam, Art and Technology Center in New 
York, the EdLab Digital Arts Residency at Columbia University, New York,
 the Interdisciplinary Residency in Art and Ecology in Guapamac&#225;taro, 
Mexico and at SPACE in London, UK.

 interaction is a challenge to any graphic production. Editorial team 
and graphic design teams must interact all the way from the first step 
of handing out the text from one to the other, until the final product 
is achieved. This is not a one-way ride. In fact, the workflow doesn&#8217;t 
flow downstream all the way. There are many stops along the way, and 
going back and forth is part of the job. How this is done? How can this 
be improved? What&#8217;s the missing link?<br>

 last LGM I did a lightning talk to present SPECIMEN, a blog and growing
 collection of graphic essays on F/LOS typefaces. This project was 
developed to rethink the traditional &#8220;neutral&#8221; form of font specimens, 
instead choosing a specific layout and content in line with the history 
and cultural implications of each typeface. An approach that takes in 
consideration the sources and the documentation of the fonts.

proposal).
<br>
                    <br>
This year, I would like to go further into the ideas developed in this 
project and show examples of F/LOS specimens (made by others and made by
 me) taking in consideration the fonts&#8217; (hi)story. The lecture has three
 aims: to provide reflection on what constitutes an appropriate specimen
 for a libre typeface, to invite font designers to share more 
information on the font&#8217;s history(ies), and to prepare the ground for 
the connected workshop, or &#8220;specimen sprint&#8221; held during LGM.<br>

                  <p class="schedule_summary" style="display: none;">With
 the invention of movable-type in 1450, writing became type-setting. 
Where a letters' shape used to be the result of the movement of hand and
 pen it became a meticoulously designed outline ready to be copied 
millions of times in mass-production. Writing turned into typograhy. 
Instead of transferring the skeleton: the gesture. We transfer it's 
facade.  And so, for more than five centuries, typography has been kept 
away from the potential of writing.
<br>
    In the progression of typography from punch cutting through to font 
design software we've ported over old physical constraints to digital 
canvases, canvasses that are really much more flexible than what we are 
currently using them as. Partly because of the typographer himself, 
feeling the custodian of a very long tradition, the constraints and 
economics of production but also for the convenience of the major 
software publishers already struggling in trying to manage and cover all
 of the world's  writing systems. OSP continues to emphasize this issue 
and would like to present the work, experiments and paths we've explored
 around this issue by showing (stroke-)fonts we've drawn but more 
importantly the tools we have and are developing to reclaim the 
potential in typography.<br>
                    <br>OSP makes graphic design using only free
 and open source software. A caravan of practitioners from diverse 
fields, they design, program, research and teach. Working for print and 
web and its hybrids, OSP creates visual identities and digital 
utilities, always digging for a more intimate relation with the tool.<br>

                  <p class="schedule_summary" style="display: none;">This
 session has two halves. First, I will present my work on two personal 
font-development tools: one is a command-line utility for automatically 
building installable release packages (in RPM, Deb, CTAN, and Zip 
format) of font families, and the other is a set of Emacs Major Modes 
for editing font files with syntax highlighting, auto-indent, and 
tokenization.  The packaging tool adresses an area often overlooked in 
open font development: rolling a release. The Emacs modes make it easier
 to edit and debug font source files. Hopefully both tools will help 
make some well-tested methods from software development more useful in 
type design.
<br>
                    <br>
Second, I'll discuss the recent effort announced on CREATE to develop 
and implement GUI UX patterns for accessing OpenType features, and why 
it's important to free software.  OpenType substitution and positioning 
features are one of the format's major selling points to type designers,
 but they have poor support in creative applications. The proprietary 
software industry has let this slide as a business decision; free 
software can deliver what users want to see.<br>

 has been the leading libre font editor for more than 10 years now. 
Three years ago I began Crafting Type, a collective and co-operative 
project to offer short type design introduction workshops around the 
world, using only libre graphics tools. Around that time the FontForge 
founder, George Williams, stepped away from the project to pursue other 
hobbies, so I stepped up to organise the development that I found 
Crafting Type participants asking for. Despite fixing many crashes and 
bugs and attempts to add brave new features, last year I became 
disheartened at the rate of progress. I began considering what an ideal 
libre font editor ought to be, and how to make it happen. This 
presentation shows where FontForge is today, various efforts to develop 
new libre font editors, and where I hope to go in the next 10 years.<br>

hundreds of such projects.<br>

The &#8220;specimen workshop&#8221;, or &#8220;specimen-sprint&#8221; is a two-hours workshop 
where the participants are invited to design specimens for F/LOS fonts, 
taking in consideration their (hi)story, and designed with F/LOS tools 
of their choice. By participating, they can help creating more 
visibility for F/LOS fonts with an approach playing on the strengths of 
the F/LOSS philosophy.
<br>
The participants will have access to references, source materials and 
information on the fonts, gathered by Loraine from the designers&#8217; 
documentation and through e-mail interviews.

                  <p class="schedule_summary" style="display: none;">Traditionally,
 the pre-production pipeline starts with a script, and then the director
 develops concept art for each scene described in the script either on 
paper or in digital form.  Following this stage, the director then works
 closely with an animator on a pre-visualization utilizing animation 
software (e.g. Autodesk Maya).  The developed scene is visualized in a 
crude form using placeholder assets, but this crude visualization 
provides the director with information about the placement of 
actors/cameras/lights/objects enabling them to quickly try out new 
ideas, different lighting characteristics, and different cinematographic
 techniques.  Once completed, a cinematographer is employed to determine
 the proper camera motions, placements, and provide critique on this 
initial design.  The design process ensues with the director and 
cinematographer discussing necessary changes and through a series of 
compromises the scene is finalized and can be produced.  This pipeline 
works for both animated and live-action pre-production, however due to 
the sheer number of people involved throughout the pre-production stage 
in defining the scene parameters, the director&#8217;s overall creative vision
 can easily be lost in the process.

                  <p class="schedule_summary" style="display: none;">Although
 we are convinced about the portential of stroke-fonts actually using 
them, while keeping their flexibility, is challenging. At the moment the
 best we can do to streamline the usage process is to freeze a version 
of the stroke at a set thickness, then outline it, building it back for 
use in current font formats. Especially on the web with it's dynamic 
potential this feels like a big loss. We look at the engineering that 
built DIN, Dr Hershey, Donald Knuth, Adobe Type 3 and SVG3 both with awe
 and equal frustration. 
<br>
                    <br>
Could their be a way to integrate a stroke font format in to publishing 
software? A new definition of how lettershapes are described for them to
 be able to be used easily? Can we imagine a type-setting system that 
doesn't precompile glyphs shape, but renders them inline, so themselve 
glyphs can become responsive? We will take a look at the existing 
standards, but also the more experimental-tools, some of which OSP is 
working on, both for print and web-publication (and SVG3?).<br>
                    <br>OSP 
is a collective of graphic designers &amp; programmers using only free 
and open source software. A caravan of practitioners from diverse 
fields, they design, program, research and teach. Working for print and 
web and its hybrids, OSP creates visual identities and digital 
utilities, always digging for a more intimate relation with the tool.

                  <p class="schedule_summary" style="display: none;">Digital
 Steganography is the practice of concealing one file type within 
another, such as text within in image (it is also a long-standing method
 of encryption used by security agencies...). In this presentation I 
will describe a novel method for encoding 3D geometric data within an 
image file that create a new, cross platform file type for 3D models. 
The X,Y, Z values of a triangulated mesh, such as would typically be 
described by an STL file, can be mapped, more or less, directly to the 
R,G,B values of a pixel within a simple PNG file. Once mapped, the data 
can be organised within the image in may novel ways that create a 2D 
representation whose data is, at the same time, both human and machine 
readable. Using a number of prototype tools, developed using the 
processing programming language, I will demonstrate the following;
<br>
- Limitless opportunities for file encryption, using custom codes as well as image editing software.
<br>
- New ways of tracking 'the diff' between various 3D models files that are enabled by this new file format.
<br>
- Improvements in file compression when compared to other 3D file formats.<br>

                  <p class="schedule_summary" style="display: none;">Over
 the past ten years I have been steadily increasing the amount of open 
source software I utilize in my design courses. I now believe I can 
teach digital media courses exclusively with free and open source 
software and not impair my students' chances of gainful employment. In 
fact, my students are better artists and designers directly because of 
their experience with open source tools. They are more versatile, easily
 adapt to change, and have a greater capacity to tinker with their 
tools. This presentation will be about the open source paradigm and its 
effect in the classroom. I will show how teaching with free and open 
source is a way to teach students the ability to learn software more 
efficiently and quickly, and inspire greater curiosity. Open source 
software not only makes students' portfolios more diverse and 
professional, it makes them better thinkers. 
<br>
                    <br>
Presently, I am leading an initiative at my college, SUNY Buffalo State,
 to adopt more open source tools. I will discuss my experience in 
adopting this software in the classroom. I will also discuss the 
opposition and controversy from colleagues that I have encountered by 
using software that &#8220;is not industry standard&#8221;.<br>

 aim of my presentation is to talk about my inspiration of the maker 
scene and to showcase my project I developed in an open source 
environment. I created a dress with LEDs soldered onto the fabric 
building a special compound and a flexible circuit. The layout has been 
done with graphical open software like inkscape and gimp and is then 
printed with conductive ink to the fabric. I used Arduino software and 
microcontroller for making smart clothes to include LEDs and 
Accelerometer. 
<br>
                    <br>
The created pattern work can be used either for fabric printing, laser 
cutting or even for sending to a hacked knitting machine to get an 
individual, customized style, fulfilling the aim that we can download 
and print clothes to start our own production. The creative culture and 
the use of free formats make it usable for further development.  
Tinkering in an open digital fabrication studio e.g. Fablab.
<br>
I plan to prepare a library of design content such as pattern printing, swatches pattern work, accessible under cc licensing. 
<br>
To participate, exchange, explore, cooperate and show contribution, free
 access of knowledge is important. Therefore we share skills and 
knowledge in the community e.g. by launching The Fashion Tec Group where
 people come to present their projects. 
<br>
Also different ideas have been presented at Meshcon and Wear it Conference and openXlab in Berlin.<br>
                    <br>I
 studied Product Development in Clothing and come from a classical 
fashion background. I worked for a clothing company. In 2009, I start to
 explore new Technology including LEDs in cloth, but it was not so easy 
to get a lot of information about it. During my research, especially the
 big Designers were at the forefront to market new Technology features. 
Although, there were only prototypes or couture pieces, they showed 
something new. Now, a lot of knowledge has been shared and during the 
codemotion in Berlin, I attended a workshop to learn about Arduino 
programming. Since then, I improved my skills in creative coding and 
eTextile. Also, I am part of the Fashion Tec Working group in Berlin to 
build a community of people to share their knowledge.<br>

                  </h3>
                  <p class="schedule_summary" style="display: none;">The
 majority of the graphic industry still think that FLOSS tools are less 
powerful than proprietary software, and we want to change this idea. 
Very often the community of a free software is so small that every skill
 level is mixed, from the amateur to the professional, contributing to 
the idea that you cannot make good art out of FLOSS tools. We know there
 are professional artists who use only FLOSS tools (David Revoy, Ramon 
Miranda, Enrico Guarnieri among others) and that most of them release 
their work under CC licenses. But apart from sharing the &#8220;copyleft&#8221; 
principle of &#8220;some rights reserved&#8221; with the open source movement, what 
is the real advantage of CC licenses? What can make them a real tool to 
spread the artwork of artists using FLOSS tools in order to make a 
difference with people using proprietary software and protecting their 
artwork under copyright laws?
<br>
                    <br>
Creative Commons Licenses can speed up the process of organizing an exhibition in two ways :
<br>
1) You don't need to ask the author permission to show his artwork
<br>
2) You don't even need to ask the HR artwork because usually you can download it
<br>
                    <br>
This means that anybody, no matter how far he is from the author and 
which budget he has, can show with low-cost tools (an empty room and a 
printer) the work of professional artists, as soon as he respects the 
attribution. In other words, compared to other cultural places here in 
Bordeaux, it could be a very simple and effective way to build a regular
 series of exhibition with something in commons. I would like to stress 
on the fact that within this context, the more we select good art, the 
more visitors would believe that professionals use FLOSS tools, so we 
could gain users and grow our community.
<br>
                    <br>
How to do it?
<br>
                    <br>
Concretely, the application of my project is to build a series of 
exhibition that will take place in Bordeaux, France, each month, is a 
series of public places (I have a couple by far, but the list is 
growing) in which to promote in turn a talented artist using FLOSS 
tools. The artist would be invited to the opening of the exhibition.
<br>
                    <br>
Where money come from?
<br>
                    <br>
Although we are talking about &#8220;low-cost&#8221; exhibition, we still need to 
cover some basic costs. Money could be raised from selling prints or a 
crowd-funding system. If the CC license does not allow commercial use, 
he could be asked to make a small modification in order to sell prints 
and gain money to cover travel costs for him/organize the next 
exhibition, with a non-profit principle.<br>

 Microraptor gui, a framework/approach for creating graphical user 
interfaces, that interleaves registering event callbacks with procedural
 drawing code backed by CSS. This gives some efficiency and flexibility 
not found in traditional scene-graph/widget hierarchy approaches; 
flexibility useful for custom canvases/controls in graphical 
applications. Demo and code heavy presentation, live coding of UIs with 
C, cairo and CSS.<br>

                  <p class="schedule_summary" style="display: none;">LibreOffice
 uses its own GUI and rendering toolkit called VCL that works across 
every major PC platform and even a few mobile platforms. On Linux it 
provides backends for Gtk and Qt. To make use of modern graphics 
hardware the LibreOffice project decided to add a cross-platform backend
 that still provides support for different GUI toolkits. 
<br>
                    <br>
Using OpenGL allows us to improve the performance of our rendering by 
moving the work from the CPU to the mostly unused GPU. It also provides 
us with fast image scaling allowing us to use better scaling algorithms 
while still supporting fast scrolling. Together with the fact that 
OpenGL allows us to innovate without being limited by the ancient 
rendering APIs provided by different systems, makes porting our 
rendering toolkit to OpenGL an attractive option.
<br>
                    <br>
Come and see how the LibreOffice embraced this challenge and implemented
 the new VCL OpenGL backend that is being shipped in LibreOffice 4.4.<br>

 is studying Mathematics at the Karlsruhe Institue for Techonoology and 
works part time on LibreOffice for Collabora. He mainly concentrates on 
LibreOffice calc and charts and in recent times the OpenGL support. He 
also maintains the LibreOffice cppunit version and is a co-maintainer of
 mdds, ixion and orcus.

 the 2014 meeting in Leipzig, the LGM community realized the need for a

sometimes difficult discussion took place around the purpose of the CoC 
and how it should be drafted and implemented. This BoF aims to look at 
the code of conduct, as it's been implemented, and to discuss how we 
might improve it or strengthen its promises in the future.</p>

 on from the Allowing Mistakes to Happen presentation, I will facilitate
 a workshop that focuses on the practical side of creating glitch art. 
The workshop will delve into the techniques utilised by glitch artists, 
such as hacking codecs, modifying hardware and repurposing software.
<br>
                    <br>
The workshop participants will need a laptop/computer 
(Mac/Windows/Linux) with the following software installed: GIMP, 
Audacity &amp; a good text editor such as Notepad++, TextEdit or Gedit.

                  <p class="schedule_summary" style="display: none;">OpenType
 features allow font files to build in a variety of optional 
functionality designed to make typography responsive and eye-pleasing: 
small-capitals, variant forms of glyphs (individually, like swash caps, 
or in stylistic sets), lining or tabular numeral options, extra 
ligatures, and even randomization.  But software support for these 
features in creative and design applications is poor-to-nonexistent, in 
both the proprietary and free-software world.
<br>
                    <br>
The proprietary world has shown no interest in changing, but that should
 not stop free software.  This meeting will examine OpenType feature 
support in libre graphics projects, looking at both the technical and 
user-experience problems that need to be solved, and what steps we must 
take to get there.<br>

 Manuals project was launched by Adam Hyde in 2007 to remedy the deficit
 of good free documentation about Free Software. Our strategy since the 
beginning has been to develop communities to produce high quality free 
manuals about Free Software in their own language. Today, through the 
use of Booksprints and federated publishing techniques we have more than
 120 books in more than 30 languages and more than 4,000 contributors. 
<br>
                    <br>
FLOSS Manuals is more than a collection of manuals about doing things 
with free and open source software, it is also the community. The 
contributors include designers, readers, writers, illustrators, free 
software fans, editors, artists, software developers, activists, and 
many others. Anyone can contribute to a manual &#8211; to fix a spelling 
mistake, add a more detailed explanation, write a new chapter, or start a
 whole new manual on a topic.
<br>
                    <br>
FLOSS Manuals now consists of 3 independent language communities 
(French, English, Finnish) supported by a Foundation based in Holland. 
Our current focus is to develop strong partnerships with grassroots 
educators to develop educational materials about free software.
<br>
                    <br>

 2015: Beyond The First Decade&#8221; has a special meaning for the Pitivi 
community, as this leading GStreamer-based video editor recently 
celebrated its own 10th anniversary.
<br>
                    <br>
In this talk, we will look at changes in the motion graphics landscape 
in recent years (shifts in filmmaking hardware and production pace,
<br>
computing power, means of distribution, etc.), take a moment to marvel 
at the progress we have made thus far (esp. from the Pitivi side), and 
another moment to ponder the herculean task that remains before us in 
order to remain relevant for the next decade.
<br>
                    <br>
This talk is intended to be less technical, touching on subjects such as
 heavy trends in the industry, FLOSS project management, economics, etc.
 All are welcome!
<br>
                    <br>
In addition to this presentation, interested parties may join us 
afterwards for an ad-hoc yet intensive testing session to weed out 
remaining bugs for the upcoming Pitivi 1.0 release.

 Animation is an online animation studio born amongst the turmoil in the
 animation industry. From the closure to Rhythm &amp; Hues and 
Dreamworks Animation; Theory looks at ways a studio can thrive in this 
changing world: Free Software (Blender, Joomla), Free Version-Control 
(Subversion), and a group of dedicated artists from around the world who
 want to make a difference. We'll talk history, present, and ultimately 
future: a place where artists can sell directly to consumers and do what
 they love.<br>

'Conversations' is an extensive collection of conversations between 
developers and designers involved in the wider ecosystem of Libre 
Graphics. Its lengthy title, _I think that conversations are the best, 
biggest thing that Free Software has to offer its user_, is taken from 
an interview with Debian developer Asheesh Laroia. His remark points at 
the difference that Free Software can make when users are invited to 
consider, interrogate and discuss not only the technical details of 
software, but its concepts and histories as well. 'Conversations' is 
edited by Femke Snelting and Christoph Haag. The publication is 
published by Constant and produced collaboratively, using a custom Libre
 Graphics workflow developed by Christoph Haag.<br>
                    <br>Christoph Haag 
studied design at the Department of Hybrid Space/Academy of Media Arts 
Cologne. Approaching graphic design from the commandline and the 
commandline from a design perspective, he is currently extending usage 
into programming. Lives and works in Augsburg, Germany.
